## About Me

I’m a software engineer who enjoys working across the stack and contributing back to the OSS community.

During my time at NVIDIA and in my own personal time I’ve contributed to, designed, and maintained multiple OSS initiatives.

I have a particular interest in high-performance computing and large-scale distributed systems, especially platforms like Kubernetes (k8s).
