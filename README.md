## About Me

I’m a software engineer who enjoys working across the stack and contributing back to the OSS community.

During my time at NVIDIA and in my own personal time I’ve contributed to, designed, and maintained multiple OSS initiatives.

I have a particular interest in high-performance computing and large-scale distributed systems, especially platforms like Kubernetes (k8s).

## Cool Projects

**Skyhook & Skyhook Packages** - An OSS k8s operator to manage node and OS customizations at runtime without having to reprovision nodes.

**GoAnywhere** - A pluggable tool that generates valid CGO bindings for your Go code. This allows you to use your Go code with python and C.

**Dotfiles Installer** - A declarative CLI tool for installing and managing dotfiles across macOS, Linux, and Windows. Built to simplify cross-platform environment setup and reduce manual configuration.
